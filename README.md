# stuffs
These are the projects that I have done during my study at university.
- Lab1 & lab2 are web application projects written in Java with no framework, and Lab3 is an app implemented based on Struts 2 framework.
- Festbox is an android app that provides the ticket purchasing and scanning (the QR code) activities.
- The Python folder includes miscellaneous things from simple games to desktop apps.
